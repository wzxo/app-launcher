# App Launcher

Ever wanted to launch apps from the aggregate menu (No)? Well now you can!

Also, you can add your own apps, if you know how.

Be careful this extension is for GNOME only! I don't think it'll do anything on KDE. 

## Install

Install extension with make by:

- Cloning this repo in your Terminal with `git clone https://github.com/wzxo/app-launcher.git`
- Finding extension folder in your Files
- Right-clicking and selecting "Open in Terminal"
- In Terminal running `make` and then `make install`

The extension then must be enabled using GNOME Extensions or the [GNOME Extensions website](https://extensions.gnome.org/local/).
